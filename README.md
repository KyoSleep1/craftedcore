# CraftedCore

This mod is my basic libary mod, so my mods would work across modloader and it won't take me that long to port my mods.

## How to use?

`modApi "dev.tocraft:craftedcore:${minecraft_version}-project.name-${craftedcore_version}"`

#### e.g. for fabric and forge projects, which use a common-project:
common: 
```Groovy
modApi "dev.tocraft:craftedcore:1.20.2-common-1.0
```

fabric:
```Groovy
modApi "dev.tocraft:craftedcore:1.20.2-fabric-1.0
```

forge:
```Groovy
modApi "dev.tocraft:craftedcore:1.20.2-forge-1.0
```


## Legal note

This mod is inspired by [Architectury API](https://github.com/architectury/architectury-api/tree/1.19.2) and therefore uses some similar scripts.
